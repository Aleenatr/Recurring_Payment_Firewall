/**
 * STEP 5 — EXTRACT SIGNALS
 *
 * Job: turn one merchant's history into six numbers in [0,1].
 *
 * Returns { core: {...} } — merchantProcessor.js:59 reads signalData.core, and
 * the schema declares signals.core (models:134-143). The six names and the
 * 0..1 bounds are fixed by that schema; do not rename or rescale them.
 *
 * ================== THE ONE RULE THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN ==================
 * HIGHER = WORSE, for all six signals.
 *
 * The inversion to "higher = safer" happens exactly ONCE, in merchantScoring.js
 * where score = 100 - penalties. Invert anywhere else as well and the product
 * recommends cancelling the honest merchants.
 * =======================================================================
 *
 * EVERY THRESHOLD BELOW IS STATED AS A SENTENCE FIRST.
 * "This signal reaches 1.0 when ___." If you cannot finish that sentence, the
 * number is not defensible and does not belong here. These are judgement calls
 * on a hand-labelled sample, not learned parameters — that is a real limitation
 * and the honest thing to say when asked where they came from.
