/**
 * STEP 8 — MERCHANT SCORING
 *
 * The module everything else exists to feed. Turns six signals plus the two
 * clustering results into a trust score, a risk band, and a list of named
 * patterns.
 *
 * Called as generateMerchantScore(cleanData, signalData, dbscanResult, kmeansResult)
 * from merchantProcessor.js:35. Return shape is read back at :61-65 and :121-122.
 *
 * ==================== HIGHER = SAFER. THIS IS THE INVERSION ================
 * The six signals are all "higher = worse". The trust score is "higher = SAFER":
 * 100 is a clean merchant, 5 is the worst we will report.
 *
 * The flip happens here and ONLY here: score = 100 - (sum of penalties).
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * WHY A PENALTY MODEL RATHER THAN A TRAINED CLASSIFIER:
 * There are no labels. Nobody has told us which merchants are actually abusive,
 * so there is nothing to train against. A weighted penalty model is honest about
 * that — it is a stated policy, auditable line by line, and every point lost is
 * attributable to a named cause in score_breakdown. A model would be a guess
 * wearing a lab coat. This is the right call for an unlabelled problem and it is
 * worth saying so out loud rather than apologising for it.

// ============================ THE PENALTY MODEL ============================
// Maximum points each factor can remove from a perfect 100.
//
// THEY SUM TO EXACTLY 95. That is deliberate: the floor is 5 BY CONSTRUCTION,
// not by clamping. A score of 5 means "every factor we measure is at its worst",
// and the 5 points that remain encode "we still might be wrong about you".
// Never reporting absolute zero on inferred evidence is a deliberate choice.
//
// The ordering encodes the product's judgement about consumer harm:
// price manipulation and identity evasion sit at the top because they are what
// stops a customer recognising and cancelling a charge.
const PENALTY_WEIGHTS = {
   price_volatility: 20,          // the headline abuse: the price moved a lot
   rename_frequency: 17,          // identity evasion: the charge became unrecognisable
   stealth_price_changes: 13,     // it moved AND they did not say
   cancellation_friction: 9,      // they could not get out
   retry_aggressiveness: 9,       // the dead card got hammered
   price_change_frequency: 7,     // it keeps moving
   chargeback: 7,                 // the bank sided with customers against them
   dispute: 4,                    // customers formally complained
   notification: 4,               // poor disclosure generally
   outlier: 5                     // does not behave like anyone else
};
// 20+17+13+9+9+7+7+4+4+5 = 95

// merchant into a monitoring programme around there, so it is an external
// benchmark rather than a number we invented.
