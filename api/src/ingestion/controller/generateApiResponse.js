/**
 * STEP 9 — GENERATE API RESPONSE
 *
 * Job: build the public read model — the flat document the dashboard actually
 * fetches. Output shape is apiResponseSchema (models:240-316).
 *
 * Called as generateApiResponse({ cleanData, signals, scoring }) from
 * merchantProcessor.js:76-80. ONE object argument.
 *
 * ==================== SIBLING, NOT A CHAIN ====================
 * This does NOT read the snapshot. It takes the same in-memory objects the
 * snapshot was built from (merchantProcessor.js:50-72 and :76-80 use the same
 * `data`, `signalData`, `scoringResult`).
 *
 * The consequence, and it is worth knowing before someone asks: you CANNOT
 * regenerate api_responses from merchant_analysis_snapshots alone. You would
 * need cleaned_data plus a re-run of the scorer. Two derived collections from
 * one computation, with no path between them.
 * ==============================================================
 *
 * NOTE THE CASE FLIP. The internal snapshot is snake_case (trust_score,
 * patterns). This public document is camelCase (riskAssessment.trustScore,
 * patternsDetected). That is not sloppiness — it is a real boundary between the
 * internal analysis record and the public contract, and public.js:114 reinforces
 * it by stripping _id/__v/timestamps so the API stays storage-agnostic.
