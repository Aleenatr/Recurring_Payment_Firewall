/**
 * ============================ WHY THIS JOB EXISTS ============================
 * Not for freshness. The stored data does not go stale on its own.
 *
 * It exists because CLUSTERING AND OUTLIER DETECTION ARE POPULATION-LEVEL
 * OPERATIONS AND SCORING IS RELATIVE. k-means partitions ALL merchants into k
 * groups. DBSCAN calls a merchant an outlier relative to the density of its
 * NEIGHBOURS. Neither is defined for one merchant in isolation — which is
 * exactly why runKMeans() and runDBSCAN() return deferred placeholders on the
 * single-merchant ingest path.
 *
 * The moment a new merchant is ingested, every existing merchant's cluster
 * membership and outlier status is potentially stale. This job is where those
 * two things become real numbers.
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * REWRITTEN 14 Aug 2026. What was wrong before:
 *
 * The old snapshot object wrote merchant.id, cleanedData, signals.coreSignals,
 * kmeansAnalysis, dbscanAnalysis and trustScore. NOT ONE of those is a path in
 * merchantAnalysisSchema (models:125-231), and Mongoose schemas are strict by
 * default — unknown fields are SILENTLY STRIPPED on write.
 *
 * So this job ran every six hours, logged a tick per merchant, and wrote
 * essentially empty documents. It failed silently and reported success. It also
 * called generateMerchantScore with its 2nd and 4th arguments swapped relative
 * to merchantProcessor.js:35, and generateApiResponse with a completely
 * different argument shape.
 *
 * Both callers now use the same contract — the one the schema agrees with.
